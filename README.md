##Challenge \#2

1. In HTML, create 3 divs
1. Give each div a background color
1. When one of the three divs is clicked do the following:
1. Give the selected/clicked div a border to indicate it has been selected
1. Reveal a form with an input box and a button
1. The user should now be able to enter a color value in the input field.
1. When the corresponding button is clicked, the currently selected div should change its background color to the color value the user entered in the input box.

Finish in under 3 hours? Figure out how to do the same with jQuery.
